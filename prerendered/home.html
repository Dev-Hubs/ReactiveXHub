                ReactiveX Hub is an innovative developer-to-developer approach in E-Learning built around the flexibility of GitHub & Open Source universe.
                <br />
                Our Hub addresses the hardship in the learning curve in ReactiveX and the complexity in acquiring or otherwise finding the proper resource to study.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this Hub we will be specific to RxJs, ReactiveX with JavaScript from biggener(reading) to expert level(contributing).
                <br />
                Although the concept is the same among all supported programming language, this will help you understand the concept and becoming a professional in JavaScript.

            <p class="text">
                ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
                <br />
                It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators
                that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level
                <br />
                threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O
